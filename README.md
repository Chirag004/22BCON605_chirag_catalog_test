# Polynomial Constant Solver

This project is a Java program that calculates the constant term of a polynomial using Lagrange Interpolation.

## Problem Description

Given a set of points `(x, y)` that lie on a polynomial of degree `k-1`, this program finds the constant term `c`, which is equal to the value of the polynomial at `x=0`. The input is provided as a JSON file.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: `org.json` for parsing JSON data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have the `org.json.jar` file added to your project's classpath.
3. Compile and run the `PolynomialConstantSolver.java` file.
4. Provide the input JSON when the program runs.
